# 1. Install following packages for connecting to Lake ------------------------------------------
# Check you haven't installed these already
# Have a look under the 'packages' tab (bottom left of screen)
# If you can see the package names below, then they have been installed
# You should only ever install once, but you can update in the tools section, under 'check for package updates'
 
install.packages("odbc")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("dbplyr")
install.packages("data.table")

# 2. Load following packages --------------------------------------------------------------------
library(odbc)
library(dplyr)
library(dbplyr)
library(data.table)

# 3. Set up the DSN (Data Source Name) -----------------------------------------------------------
# Control panel -> Administrative Tools -> Data Sources(odbc)
# Click add
# Select 'SQL server' from list - > finish
# Give connection a name (mine is LT) - you don't need any quotes, just a name
# Ignore the description box
# Enter server name (log on to your SQL and copy name from 'server name' box)
# Click next
# Make no changes on remaining screens
# Just press 'next' until you get to finish, and then press 'finish'
# Then test the connection and then press ok in all open boxes

# 4. Connect to Data Lake -----------------------------------------------------
 
# Set up a project in the IA area (the area where you save work from the datalake)
 
# If you don't know about 'projects' then visit https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects
# DO NOT set up a project in any other directory
# For example mine looks like the following "Z:/IA_UserData/louis.thackray/THIN Project/THIN.R/THIN.Project"
# I would like to query the following table - THIN_med1705

# 5. R and the DataLake
# Open a new script in your project (IA dataset above)
# Copy the code below and paste into R
# Change the dsn to whatever personalised name you used in the DSN, below I put LT
# Then put in whichever database you chose, I chose 'THIN_med1705
# And then run the code
 
conn <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                       dsn = "LT",
                       Database = "THIN_med1705",
                       encrypt = "true",
                       trusted_connection = "true")
