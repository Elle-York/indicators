df[2:3, ] # Bring back rows 2 to 3

df[, 2] # Bring back column 2

df[1:2, c(1, 3)] # Bring rows 1 to 2, and columns 1 and 3


# You need to use a dollar in the subsetting below. The dollar sign is used when we want to select columns. We have to put the dataset name/dollar/column name (ugh!)

mtcars[mtcars$mpg > 20 & mtcars$cyl == 6, ] # Bring back everything that is greater than 20 in one column and also equals 6 in another column. 

df[df$column_name > 20, ] # Bring back all rows in this column greater than 20

# Or you could use the subset function

subset(mtcars, mpg > 20) # Bring back all rows in this column greater than 20

subset(mtcars, mpg > 20 & cyl == 6) # Bring back everything that is greater than 20 in one column and also equals 6 in another column.
